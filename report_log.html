	I went through a few excercises today. Had some difficulty
	understanding what the % character does. I went on various sites,
	each having different ways of defining %, also tried calculating
	the math to see how it got the solution. Yet I did not come to undstand
	it.

	During today's class i got through 9 excercises. I was introduced to gets.chomp 
	and escape sequences. Overall I have not faced much difficulty understanding the material.
